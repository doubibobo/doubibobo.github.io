abstract = {Methods based on convolutional neural networks have achieved excellent performance in the image dehazing task. Unfortunately, most of the dehazing methods that exist suffer from loss of detail in the convolution and activation operations and failure to consider the effects of superimposing different intensities of haze, such as under-exposed and over-exposed images. To address these issues, we propose a dynamic dehazing convolution (DDC) based on attentional weight calculation and dynamic weight fusion and a dynamic dehazing activation (DDA) based on the input global context encoding function to address the problem of detail loss. And we propose a multi-scaled feature-fused image dehazing network (MFID-Net) based on DDC and DDA to address the effects of haze superposition. We also design a loss function based on the physical model with dynamic weights. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MFID-Net performs favorably against the state-of-the-art algorithms on the hazy dataset while improving further on hazy images with large differences in haze concentration, and producing satisfactory dehazing results.
